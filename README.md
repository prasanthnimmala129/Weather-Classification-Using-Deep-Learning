# Weather Classification Using Deep Learning Project

This research proposes an automated weather classification framework using VGG16 with transfer learning and Apache Spark to reduce costs, computation, and data complexity. It enables accurate recognition of conditions like ☀️sun, ☁️cloud, 🌫️fog and ❄️snow, supporting agriculture, tourism, safety, and real-time climate decision-making.
